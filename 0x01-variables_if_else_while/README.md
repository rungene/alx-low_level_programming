### Tasks

- 0-positive_or_negative.c - This program will assign a random number to the variable n each time it is executed. Complete the source code in order to print whether the number stored in the variable n is positive or negative.
- 1-last_digit.c- This program will assign a random number to the variable n each time it is executed. Complete the source code in order to print the last digit of the number stored in the variable n.
- 2-print_alphabet.c - Write a program that prints the alphabet in lowercase, followed by a new line.
- 3-print_alphabets.c - Write a program that prints the alphabet in lowercase, and then in uppercase, followed by a new line.
- 4-print_alphabt.c - Write a program that prints the alphabet in lowercase, followed by a new line.
- 5-print_numbers.c - Write a program that prints all single digit numbers of base 10 starting from 0, followed by a new line.
- 6-print_numberz.c - Write a program that prints all single digit numbers of base 10 starting from 0, followed by a new line.
- 7-print_tebahpla.c - Write a program that prints the lowercase alphabet in reverse, followed by a new line.
- 8-print_base16.c - Write a program that prints all the numbers of base 16 in lowercase, followed by a new line.
- 9-print_comb.c - Write a program that prints all possible combinations of single-digit numbers.
